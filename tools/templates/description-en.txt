PubNL Translator allows you to watch content by [NPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Publieke_Omroep_%28organisation%29) with subtitles in a language other than Dutch. Subtitles are translated using Google Translate and can be translated to any language it supports.

**How to use PubNL Translator**

After installing, start watching any video on an NPO website. Make sure to enable the subtitles. PubNL Translator will automatically translate the subtitles and replace them in the video.

By default, PubNL Translator will translate subtitles into English, but this can be changed to any language that Google Translate supports.
